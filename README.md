Determining the similarity between abstract scenes is a difficult problem in
cognitive computing. Humans can look at two images or videos and immediately
tell if they are similar, but this intuition is difficult to encode.


We present an application of 2D human pose estimation for accessing similarity between
motions in the space of weightlifting. Given input video of a person performing
an exercise, our system will access their form. That is, it will give a similarity
score between the user's motion and that motion performed "ideally".
